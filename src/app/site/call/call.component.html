          As part of the COVID-19 Recovery and Resilience Program, Mastercard Foundation is running a public awareness
          campaign to share timely, accurate information about the coronavirus, how it is spread, and how young people
          are adapting to their new reality.

          The Campaign seeks to enhance dissemination, understanding and uptake of public health information as a key
          outcome. The Campaign targets to reach the majority of populations, making use of multi-communication channels
          and tactics.

          The goal is to engage young people across seven countries (Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Nigeria, Ghana and
          Senegal) to share stories about their personal experiences navigating life during the global pandemic. The
          storytelling should take the form of photographs and videos.

          Bobby Pall Photography (The Organizer) is partnering with the Foundation on this Campaign that provides
          photographers and videographers with the opportunity to actively participate in the COVID-19 Recovery and
          Resilience Programme and to acquire international exposure when their work is published in the online/virtual
          gallery. By choosing to participate in this Campaign, the Entrant agrees to the following official guidelines
          and rules, which create a contract between him/her and the Organizer.

          The theme of the photography and videography campaign is: ‘African Resilience in the Wake of a Pandemic’.

          Please read the guidelines and rules carefully before submitting your entry.
